Winter
Winter is the coldest time of the year. It is one of the four seasons. Winter comes after autumn and is before spring.
Winter begins around the winter solstice. In the Northern Hemisphere the winter solstice is usually December 21 or December 22. In the Southern Hemisphere the winter solstice is usually June 21 or June 22. The days become shorter and the nights become longer.
Some animals hibernate during this season. In temperate climates there are no leaves on deciduous trees in winter. One of the holidays in winter is Christmas.
