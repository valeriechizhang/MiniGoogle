War
War is any fighting that includes the organized and intentional use of weapons and harmful force between countries or other groups of people.
War can hurt people on both sides. International law has tried to reduce the harmful effects of war. The signing of the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the development of the United Nations have tried to limit wars. Examples include:
"armed conflict",
"state aggression by armed force", or
"crime against international peace."
See Articles 2(3), 2(4) and 2(7) of the United Nations Charter.
Many years ago, a German soldier named Karl von Clausewitz wrote in his classic book, On War: "Der Krieg ist eine blo√üe Fortsetzung der Politik mit anderen Mitteln" ("War is just politics by other means") and "War is a way of using force to get our enemies to do what we want them to do."
Wars have been fought to control natural resources, for religious or cultural reasons, over political balances of power, legitimacy (correctness) of particular laws, to settle arguments about land or money, and many other issues. The reasons of any war are very complex; while a war can start for just about any reason, there is usually more than one cause.
