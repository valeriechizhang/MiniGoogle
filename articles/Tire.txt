Tire
A tire (British tyre) is the part of a wheel which is made of rubber. There are tires on many vehicles, such as cars, airplanes, bicycles, wheelbarrows and other things that need to move around smoothly.
Tires need to be changed after their treads wear away. Driving with worn tires is very dangerous. It can cause the tire to explode and the driver to lose control.
