Tuberculosis
Tuberculosis, or TB for short, is an infectious disease caused by bacteria. It used to be called consumption.
TB is caused by several types of mycobacteria, usually Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The disease usually attacks the lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body. The bacteria can travel through the air and spread from one person to the next. This happens when infected people cough, sneeze, or spit. Between five and ten people show symptoms, for every hundred people infected. In these people, the disease is called active. Tuberculosis kills more than half of the people who are infected if they do not get treatment.
