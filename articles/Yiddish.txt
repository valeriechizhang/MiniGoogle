Yiddish
Yiddish is a language used by some Jews. At first it was a dialect of the German language which Jews began to use in Europe about a thousand years ago. It was (and is) used in the United States, especially in New York. Most of its words are of German origin. Also, Yiddish has many words from Hebrew and Slavic languages, notably Polish. Yiddish is usually written in Hebrew characters.
In the whole world, Yiddish is spoken by about 3 million people. It is mainly spoken by Hasidic Jews.
