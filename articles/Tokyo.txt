Tokyo
Tokyo (東京, Tōkyō?, "Eastern Capital") is the capital city of Japan and is a prefecture of Japan on the island of Honshu. It is officially called Tokyo Metropolis (東京都, Tōkyō-to?), and it includes the former Tokyo Prefecture (東京府, Tōkyō-fu?) and the former city of Tokyo (東京市, Tōkyō-shi?).
Tokyo is the center of the Japanese government. The Imperial Palace is in Tokyo.
Greater Tokyo includes land in the Kantō region and also the Izu Islands and Ogasawara Islands.
Ten percent (10%) of the Japanese people live in Tokyo, and as many as twenty percent (20%) of the population live around it. As of 2007, the population was 12,790,000. Tokyo is the center of business, trade, and industry of Japan and also of Asia. The city is the center of the largest metropolitan area in the world.
Tokyo is in a part of Japan called the Kanto Plain. It faces Tokyo Bay. Two big rivers run through Tokyo. One is the Arakawa River which runs from the north to the south, and flows into Tokyo Bay. The other is the Tama River which runs from the west to the east. The Tama River is a border between Tokyo and its neighbor city, Kawasaki.
Tokyo means "the Eastern capital" in Japanese. It became the capital city of Japan in the middle of 19th century, when its name changed from "Edo" to "Tokyo". Before then, Kyoto was the capital of Japan. The Emperor of Japan, Tenno, lived in Kyoto. Edo was the place where the Tokugawa Shoguns lived. The city grew up under the control of the shoguns. Before then it was a small town on the sea. Edo means "the mouth of a river" in Japanese.

Tokyo was destroyed by fires started by the Great Kantō earthquake in 1923. It was also badly damaged by bombs during World War II. After Japan lost the war, the city was rebuilt.
