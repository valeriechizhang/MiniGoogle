Yoga
Yoga is an old discipline from India. Yoga uses breathing techniques, exercise and meditation. It claims to improve health and happiness.
Yoga is the Sanskrit word for union.
Patanjali was a pioneer of classical yoga. He defined yoga as "the cessation of the modification of the mind." (stopping changing the mind).
For example, the "sun-salutation" contains 12 poses of asanas one after the other and is said to help balance body and soul.
