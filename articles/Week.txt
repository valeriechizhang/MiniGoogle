Week
A week is seven days in connecting order. There are usually fifty-two (52) weeks in a year.
In the English language, the days of a week are named after the gods in Norse mythology except Saturday, which is named after a Roman god.
Saturday and Sunday are called the 'week end', but Sunday is the first day and Saturday is the seventh.
