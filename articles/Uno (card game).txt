Uno (card game)
Uno is an American card game that was made by Merle Robbins in 1971. It has since been bought by a company named Mattel. It uses 108 special cards that are made just to play Uno. It is similar to Crazy Eights.
The cards are put into 4 different groups: Red cards, green cards, blue cards and yellow cards. There are also some other cards called "Special Cards". Skip, Reverse, Draw +2, Wild, and Wild +4 cards allow you to do something you cannot normally do, such as pick up two more cards.
The game's name is also sometimes written in capital letters - UNO.
