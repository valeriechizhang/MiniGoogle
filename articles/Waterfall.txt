Waterfall
A waterfall is a body of water that rushes down a steep ledge. The water flows from higher land, then it falls down a big step of rock to lower land where it will continue on its journey. Waterfalls are usually made when a river is young.
The highest waterfall in the world is Angel Falls in Venezuela where the water falls 979 m (3,212 ft).
